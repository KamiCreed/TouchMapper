# TouchMapper
TouchMapper is an Android App lets you map gamepad input to touch events in the screen without needing to root the device. It is inteded to be used in Android TV where you don't have a touch screen and you might want to play games that only support touch events as input. 
It's licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3).

Other reason to use it in Android TV is because in order to make it work without rooting the device you'll need to keep a computer connected to the device through ADB during the time you are using the touch mapper, and the most comfortable way to do that would be to run ADB through WIFI otherwise you'll need to keep an usb connected to the device at all times.

In order to make it a bit easier, a desktop application is available that automates all process needed to run the adb commands. You can find it here: [Touch Mapper Launcher](https://github.com/Shyri/TouchMapperLauncher)

This software is completely experimental, meaning you shouldn't be surprised if it suddenly stops working and you need to restart it or whatever other issues that might show up.
