# TouchMapper
TouchMapper is an Android App lets you map gamepad input to touch events in the screen without needing to root the device. It is inteded to be used in Android TV where you don't have a touch screen and you might want to play games that only support touch events as input. 

Other reason to use it in Android TV is because in order to make it work without rooting the device you'll need to keep a computer connected to the device through ADB during the time you are using the touch mapper, and the most comfortable way to do that would be of course running ADB through WIFI otherwise you'll need to keep an usb connected to the device at all times.

In order to make it a bit easier a desktop application is available that sort of automates all processes needed to run the adb commands check it here: [Touch Mapper Launcher](https://github.com/Shyri/TouchMapperLauncher)

Below you can find all available information for regular users and developers that might want to tweak or fork the project:
